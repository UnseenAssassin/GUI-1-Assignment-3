Gui Assignment: Creating A Multiplication Table
Description: This website provides a webpage where the user is prompted to input a starting and ending value between 
-50 and 50.  The values will create a multiplication table between the numbers that were given in an organized table format.  If the 
user were to try and input a value lower than -50 and higher than 50, it will give a message on the text box asking them to insert a number
that is valid.  If the user tried to enter anything but a number like a letter, it will also give a message asking the user to input a valid number
